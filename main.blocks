Each wheel can be controlled independently using the left_wheel() and right_wheel functions.  Pass in any of forward, reverse or stop to control which direction it travels.

maxSpeed controls the speed at which the wheels turn.  1000 should be the maximum, but this could be reduced depending on the surface the robot is running on.

Complete the forever block to get the robot moving through the maze.  This should constantly fire a sonar pulse ahead of the robot, sense the returning pulse, and then give a distance to the next wall.

Use the Sonar extension (should be included) to use a sensor to detect a distance to an object in front of the robot.  If the distance is small enough, make a right turn and try to move forward from there.  If we get too close to a wall, try to reverse a short distance.

Maze solving is based on the principle of the Right-Hand rule, where a simple maze can be solved by following the wall on your right.  While you may hit a number of dead-ends, you should eventually reach the exit.</comment><block type="function_definition" id="?NYyi+YZqaA{E}p,,%NZ" collapsed="true" x="-553" y="-25"><mutation name="brake" functionid="L[C$wU/T`kQ#srWJjM[w"/><field name="function_name">brake</field><statement name="STACK"><block type="function_call" id="W^aJ|y}O0HGW%@]f5;KL"><mutation name="left_wheel" functionid="2`mWB~;%=d18uD+sO!k9"><arg name="direction" id="2LDlPLpvuh2UqMUc)Txr" type="number"/></mutation><value name="2LDlPLpvuh2UqMUc)Txr"><shadow type="math_number" id="p5E@B(*pA3Vf?~Tf,Mi8"><field name="NUM">0</field></shadow></value><next><block type="function_call" id="E6Getr5~J$~@F;t~_vJv"><mutation name="right_wheel" functionid="S0yb1)C+VAP+epw,LM`n"><arg name="direction" id="2LDlPLpvuh2UqMUc)Txr" type="number"/></mutation><value name="2LDlPLpvuh2UqMUc)Txr"><shadow type="math_number" id="|2Usy5+=evh5+MR=uhiT"><field name="NUM">0</field></shadow></value></block></next></block></statement></block></xml>
